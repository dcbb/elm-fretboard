# elm-fretboard
A simple Elm app for visualising intervals on the guitar fretboard to figure out complex chords.

Also an experiment with the [Style Elements](http://package.elm-lang.org/packages/mdgriffith/style-elements/latest) package. And with me learning Elm.

**FAQ**

_Why are the interval names funny?_

There are may ways of naming intervals. The ones used here are loosely based on the chord symbols used in jazz. If you have suggestions for improvement, feel free to get in touch!

Notes are named and colored according to the largest interval selected in the interval buttons at the bottom.

Yes, click "show notes" at the bottom.
